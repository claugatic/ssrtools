The executables are:

 - ss_trans.exe translates input files from the SS 3.24 format to the SS 3.30 format
 - ss.exe is the SS 3.30 executable
 - ss_opt.exe is the optimized (faster, but less error checking) version of the SS 3.30 executable
 
The required input files are:
 - starter.ss  (which contains the filenames for the data and control files)
 - <data file>  with name matching that in starter.ss
 - <control file>  with name matching that in starter.ss
 - forecast.ss
 - wtatage.ss  (conditional on control file switch specifying use of empirical body weight-at-age)

For existing models with input files in SS 3.24 format, 
use ss_trans.exe to translate input files from SS 3.24 format to SS 3.30 format.

If you are using the GUI, it will detect if input files are 3.24 and guide you through the conversion.
You also can manually go through the conversion steps below.

The translated input files are the *.ss_new files produced by ss_trans.exe:

 - make a new directory for the SS 3.30 run
 - copy data.ss_new to the new directory and rename it to the original input data file name
 - copy control.ss_new to the new directory and rename it to the original input control file name
 - copy forecast.ss_new to the new directory and rename it to forecast.ss
 - copy starter.ss_new to the new directory and rename it to starter.ss
 - if applicable, copy wtatage.ss_new to the new directory and rename it to wtatage.ss

After the new input files have been edited to address any warnings or other issues, 
then ss.exe or ss_opt.exe can be used.

ss_trans.exe cannot completely convert all aspects of time-varying parameter specifications, 
so examine the control.ss_new file before using it as the basis for your updated assessment.

Running SS:
1.  open a command shell window in the folder containing your input files and ss.exe (or have ss.exe in your path, or named in a .bat file)
2.  type "ss" followed by any ADMB commands, such as -nohess
3.  ss will start by reading starter.ss, then the data file, then forecast.ss, then control file, then (optionally) wtatage.ss
4.  as ss reads those files, information is output to echoinput.ss and warnings.ss
5.  if something goes wrong with the read or first iteration of ss, looking at echoinput and warnings is your first recourse.
6.  ss will display some info to the screen as it runs, then output goes to a set of files with *.sso names.
